# GuildInventory
**Version:** 0.7
**Game Version:** Turtle WoW (Interface 11200)

GuildInventory is a shared inventory for guilds. Members can add items that they want to make available to other members.
There's a request function where you can request items. A message will automatically be delievered to the right people when they come online.

Now also tracks tradeskill recipes so you can easily find out who can craft what in your guild. You have to manually open your crafting window for recipes to be registered and shared.

Still BETA! Expect some bugs!

## âœ¨ Inventory Usage

Drag & drop items from your inventory or bank to add items. If you put an item in the last slot the inventory will expand.
The ordering of items is local to you only, so you can use drag & drop to order them however you want. Note that any items being added during a sync will be added to the first avaiable slots.

Clicking an item will show you who has the item avaiable. You can also update your own count and set a price for the item.
Setting your count to 0 will remove the item if no other members has added any.

The `sync inventory` and `sync bank` buttons will updated the count of any items you've added with the total from your inventory/bank.
Note that you have to either add items from your inventory or update the count manually on items first for the sync to work.

You can assign a hotkey in Key Bindings to toggle the window.
